# AWS S3 Conditional Requests Examples

## Main Advantage of S3 Conditional Requests

AWS S3 Conditional Requests allow you to perform operations on S3 objects only if specific conditions are met. This powerful feature enables you to:

1. **Prevent Data Conflicts**: Ensure you're not overwriting data that has been changed by someone else.
2. **Save Bandwidth**: Avoid downloading or uploading data unnecessarily.
3. **Implement Atomic Operations**: Perform updates that either succeed completely or not at all, without needing external locking mechanisms.
4. **Optimize Performance**: Reduce latency and improve response times in your applications.
5. **Ensure Data Consistency**: Maintain data integrity in distributed systems and concurrent environments.

In simpler terms, it's like being able to say to S3:
- "Only give me this file if it has changed since I last saw it."
- "Only update this file if no one else has changed it since I last saw it."

This makes it much easier to build applications that work correctly and efficiently, even when many users or processes are working with the same data simultaneously.

## Repository Purpose

This repository demonstrates the power and utility of AWS S3 Conditional Requests through practical examples. Our goal is to showcase how these requests can be leveraged to build more efficient, scalable, and robust cloud applications.

## Current Examples

### 1. Efficient Caching Strategy (`caching_example.py`)

This example demonstrates how to implement an efficient caching mechanism using S3 Conditional Requests. It shows how to:

- Reduce bandwidth usage by avoiding unnecessary data transfers
- Improve application performance by utilizing client-side caching
- Handle cache invalidation efficiently

### 2. Atomic Operations for Rate Limiting (`rate_limiter.py`)

This example showcases how to implement atomic operations using S3 Conditional Requests. It demonstrates:

- How to create a distributed rate limiter without additional infrastructure
- Handling concurrent modifications safely
- Implementing retry logic for robust operations

## TODO examples

- Optimistic concurrency control for collaborative editing
- Versioned configurations management
- Data pipeline integrity checks
- Audit trail implementation
- Distributed locking mechanisms

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up your AWS credentials
4. Run the examples:

python caching_example.py
python rate_limiter.py

## Prerequisites
